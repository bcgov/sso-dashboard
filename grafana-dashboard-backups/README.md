# Backups for the Grafana dashboards

The following backups are for the [Grafana](https://sso-grafana.apps.gold.devops.gov.bc.ca/) dashboards. They are created using the grafana json export feature.

The documentation on sharing dashboards is documented [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/share-dashboards-panels/).  It generates a json file that can be restored by creating a new dashboard and importing the file.
